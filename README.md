## üìö What I Learned

- Gained hands-on best-practice experience through rapid prototyping and iterative refactoring, restructuring component hierarchies and evolving code architecture to support complex user interactions, motion design, and seamless UI flow.
- Refined accessibility by auditing and aligning all interactive elements with meaningful ARIA labels, ensuring inclusivity while preserving the fluid motion and visual rhythm of the interface.
- Improved the Wave Prism animation‚Äôs rendering consistency by fine-tuning vector stroke weights, canvas dimensions, and layout flow.
- Strengthened Git and GitHub workflow discipline by simulating real-world release processes and managing multi-stage versioning.
- Deepened understanding of data flow by defining Zod schemas in TypeScript, integrating Supabase, and connecting the backend to the frontend survey form for validated data handling.
